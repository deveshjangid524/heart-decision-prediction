Heart Disease Prediction Model This project is a Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction System that helps predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on key medical attributes. Built using Python, this model uses popular ML libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, and applies classification algorithms to predict heart disease with high accuracy.

🔍 Overview Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early diagnosis can significantly reduce risks and improve treatment outcomes. This project aims to leverage data-driven techniques to provide a fast, reliable, and cost-effective method for early heart disease prediction.

📊 Dataset The dataset used is a publicly available Heart Disease UCI dataset, containing patient records with 13 key features such as:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type (cp)

Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)

Serum Cholesterol (chol)

Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)

Resting ECG Results (restecg)

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)

Exercise-Induced Angina (exang)

ST Depression (oldpeak)

Slope of the ST Segment (slope)

Number of Major Vessels (ca)

Thalassemia (thal)
